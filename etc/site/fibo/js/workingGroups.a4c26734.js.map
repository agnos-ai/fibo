The specification provides a model of business concepts that are common to all financial services including products and services, financial instruments, market types, financial intermediaries, registration authorities and regulators. These common concepts are linked to many other financial contract domain and process areas in FIBO. Moreover, FBC/SEC is a baseline domain ontology defining equities (equity instruments, depository receipts, equity issuance, limited partnership equity, shareholder rights and shareholder equity), bonds (concepts relating to cash debt instruments, listings, tax treatment, debt guarantees, parity variants, participation notes and cash flow), money markets (REPOs, term deposits and short term debt), and other securities (baskets, parametric schedules, pools, securities classification, securities identification, issuance, listings, restrictions and assets).\r\n                <a\r\n                  class=\"bttn\"\r\n                  id=\"email_1524650877557\"\r\n                  href=\"mailto:rtrypuz@edmcouncil.org?subject=Request%20to%20Join%20FIBO%20FBCSEC%20Team\"\r\n                >Apply to join team</a>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>FIBO Indices and Indicators (IND Team)</td>\r\n              <td>Elisa Kendall</td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                IND covers concepts relating to forms of market indices (including baskets, credit and debt indices), economic indicators, economic measures, market-based interest rates and foreign exchange as well as ontologies relating to common interest rates, inter-bank lending and rates of debt instruments.\r\n                <a\r\n                  class=\"bttn\"\r\n                  id=\"email_1524650877557\"\r\n                  href=\"mailto:rtrypuz@edmcouncil.org?subject=Request%20to%20Join%20FIBO%20IND%20Team\"\r\n                >Apply to join team</a>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>FIBO Ratings (Ratings FCT)</td>\r\n              <td>Cory Casanave</td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                The Ratings FCT is working to expand the concepts associated with market and credit ratings.\r\n                <a\r\n                  class=\"bttn\"\r\n                  id=\"email_1524650877557\"\r\n                  href=\"mailto:rtrypuz@edmcouncil.org?subject=Request%20to%20Join%20FIBO%20Ratings%20Team\"\r\n                >Apply to join team</a>\r\n              </td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n          </table>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <h3>FIBO JIRA</h3>\r\n        <p>\r\n          To\r\n          become part of the team, you will need to have a GitHub user (you can request to connect to FIBO using an\r\n          existing user name) and you must request to have access to FIBO JIRA.\r\n          Links are below:\r\n        </p>\r\n        <div class=\"table-responsive\">\r\n          <table class=\"table table-style-grey\">\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>\r\n                <a href=\"https://github.com/edmcouncil\">\r\n                  <strong>EDMC GitHub</strong>\r\n                </a>\r\n              </td>\r\n              <td>The EDM Council GitHub repositories</td>\r\n              <td>\r\n                All FIBO content and tooling are here.
