For each discussed and approved JIRA-based\n          change request there can be one or more \"committed changes\" to that git repository where each series of\n          changes triggers the build process on Jenkins. Production-FIBO is the tested, vetted version and is published\n          quarterly. Development-FIBO is published as content is added and tested. FIBO automation extends opportunities\n          to all FIBO participants in the industry for both fixes and enhancements.\n        </p>\n\n        <h6>\n          See FIBO\n          <a href=\"release.html\">Release Notes</a>.\n        </h6>\n      </article>\n    </main>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  name: 'development',\n  components: {},\n};\n</script>\n\n<style>\narticle {\n  padding-top: 30px;\n}\narticle h2 {\n  font-size: 17px;\n  color: #455560;\n  line-height: 28px;\n  text-transform: none;\n  padding-top: 30px;\n  padding-bottom: 10px;\n  text-align: left;\n  font-weight: 400;\n  letter-spacing: 1px;\n}\n</style>\n","import mod from \"-!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Development.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Development.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./Development.vue?vue&type=template&id=0695e67f&\"\nimport script from \"./Development.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./Development.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nimport style0 from \"./Development.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&lang=css&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  null,\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports"],"sourceRoot":""}
